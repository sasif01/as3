#INTRODUCTION 
#Carnivora constitutes a significant order within Mammalia. Carnivora is one of the few mammalian orders that include terrestrial and aquatic species and appears regularly on all continents. It also has one of the largest size ranges of any mammalian order, from 35 g to 5000 kg (Nyakatura & Bininda-Emonds, 2012). The order Carnivora has two clades: Feliformia (cat-like carnivorans) and Caniformia (dog-like carnivorans). The size and diet of carnivores vary widely, from little stoats to bears and from meat-eating like a cheetah to vegetable-eating like a panda. Carnivores also have a broad range of habitat tolerance. They may be found in all terrestrial and aquatic environments, from the domestic cat (Felis catus) to the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), from the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) to the polar bear (Ursus maritimus). Even though the order Carnivora originated in North America roughly 42 million years ago from members of the family Miacidae, its species presently inhabit a variety of continents, latitudes, and longitudes. The question is whether America still has the highest abundance of carnivores among the five continents of the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.
#A study was conducted in 2005 on the evolution of eight Carnivora families that have migrated across the Northern Hemisphere to determine if continental invasions also lead to explosive diversification dynamics, using a Bayesian approach to estimate speciation and extinction rates from a large dataset of fossil occurrences. The radiation of arriving lineages from North America to Eurasia correlates with the loss of existing lineages or stages of climatic change, indicating that ecological variations across continents may be responsible for the different rates of diversification. The fossil record also implies that North America and Eurasia are involved in faunal exchanges (Pires et al., 2015). Due to the migration of carnivores across the three continents, which one of the two Eurasian continents will have a species composition most comparable to that of the continent of origin (America)?

# RESULT AND DISCUSSION
# Given that North America is the origin of Carnivora order, one of the predictions for this experiment is that carnivores will be most abundant there. With its long history and extensive exposure, the order expects to be more able to adapt to the environment of the American continent than others. In addition, a study by Pires et al. revealed a continental faunal of carnivores between Eurasia and North America (2015). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect North America, Europe, and Asia to contain the highest proportion of carnivores. The Americas, Europe, and Asia have the highest abundance of carnivores, respectively, among the five continents shown in Figure 1. The predictions were accurate.
# The accumulation curve shown in Figure 2 aims to comprehend the BIN composition of survey plots and predict species abundance. For several reasons, the accumulation curve does not provide the optimal outcome. First, the data set has a small size. It is acceptable if certain species are unavailable on a specific continent. However, even if they are available on one continent, the numbers of variables only contain from one to five observations per species. Additionally, Oceania contains just 101 observations, of which 100 correspond to the first variable, BOLD:AAA1542. The data was insufficient. Hence the algorithm was unable to display the Oceania data on the accumulation curve and provide a meaningful prediction for this experiment.
# According to the first two tests, America and Europe have the highest abundance, so it is reasonable to assume that these two variables will have a stronger correlation than America and Asia. The correlations between continents were explored using a PCA test. The findings demonstrate that the Americas and Asia are strongly correlated, but Europe has a lower correlation with the other variables. This finding contrasts with the expectations, indicating that even though one continent has higher individual numbers, it does not necessarily have a higher probability of possessing the same BINs as another continent. Even if the data set is insufficient for a prediction test, it is adequate to answer all questions listed. A few requirements must be applied to a data set before it can qualify for a larger project. First, the number of observations after filtering must be raised to at least 30 per species on a single continent to be considered statistical significance. Second, the order Carnivora includes 296 species categorized into 16 families (Hassanin et al., 2021), yet the data set only includes 143 species. It implies that not only must the number of observations be raised, but also the number of variables. A larger project could perhaps compare the BIN composition of each continent now with that of 50 years ago to see whether climate change and global warming have a role in the changes and, if so, to determine if the changes are statistically significant.
